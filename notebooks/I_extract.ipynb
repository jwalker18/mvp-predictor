    "### The NBA Most Valuable Player Award is the most prestigious individual award handed out in the regular season. It has large implications for a players' career with MVP winners being viewed as the best in the game. \n",
    "### However, there is no clear criteria for judging the winner, and fans and analysts alike debate fiercly both about who is most deserving as well as the criteria used to determine the MVP. Here, I attempt to elucidate the important features for MVPs and develop a model to predict future winners."
