# mvp-predictor
A machine learning model for predicting the winner of the NBA MVP award.

Completed Jupyter notebooks are located in the notebooks/ directory along with the `.pkl` files necessary for their completion. Notebooks are titled in order of completion. The `mvp_functions` package contains the functions necessary for the completion of the notebooks.

## Contributing and Development
If you would like to reproduce the results or contribute, clone the repo then `cd` into it. Install the required packages using (I suggest using a virtual environment to prevent issues with your local python install).

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then install the `mvp_functions` package from the `setup.py` file using

```bash
pip install -e .
```
